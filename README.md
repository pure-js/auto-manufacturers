## Assignment
A web application with a list of vehicle manufacturers which I can click on to see them in detail.  
The whole application is utilizing publicly accessible data https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/.  
The list of manufacturers is an infinity loading table with these columns: ID, common name and country. Besides that, there's an additional column with a button which leads to the detail page.  
The detail page shows me exactly the same data as in the list + there's a list of all the model names of all the makes of that one manufacturer.  
Keep in mind the best practices for building web applications including automated testing and performance.
