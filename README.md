## Assignment

A web application with a list of vehicle manufacturers that I can click on to view them in detail.
The entire application is utilizing publicly accessible data https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/.  
The list of manufacturers is an infinite loading table with the following columns: ID, common name and country. In addition, there is an additional column with a button that leads to the detailed information page.  
The detail page shows me exactly the same data as in the list + there's a list of all the model names of all the makes of that one manufacturer.  
Keep in mind the best practices for building web applications, including automated testing and performance.
